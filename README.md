# Number-Patterns
Day 13 of my coding challenge focuses on mastering number pattern problems in C++ using nested loops. Pattern problems are fundamental for building strong logic, improving loop control, and understanding how rows and columns interact in console-based programs. 
This challenge includes triangular, square, pyramid, Floyd’s triangle, and diamond patterns.

# Patterns Implemented

Increasing Number Triangle (Row-based)

Decreasing Number Triangle (Row-based)

Increasing Number Triangle (Column-based)

Decreasing Number Triangle (Column-based)

Square Pattern (Row numbers)

Square Pattern (Column numbers)

Number Pyramid

Floyd’s Triangle

Diamond Pattern

# Concepts Used

Nested for loops

Loop counters (i, j)

Conditional logic

Space management for alignment

Console output formatting

# Learning Outcome

Strong understanding of nested loops

Clear distinction between row-based and column-based patterns

Improved logical thinking for pattern alignment

Confidence in handling classic interview pattern questions

# How to Run

Clone the repository

Open the C++ file in any IDE or compiler

Compile and run the program

Enter the value of n when prompted
